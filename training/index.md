### Transition To Android

Lets face it, many companies have asked their back-end or any other tech people to setup a mobile team. End result has not been pretty. Yes your guys learnt something but you paid heavy cost indirectly. Now the codebase is not maintainable and writing from scratch does not seem to be a viable option. Irrespective of how hard they tried, mental model of working in mobile is quite different from working in web or whatever tech they come from. I have a solution for you.

Either your company is setting up a mobile team OR you as individual want to move to mobile development. I offer personalised training to ensure smooth transition. Pre-requisite of this training is you must be a programmer and famiiar with OOPS. I will cover all Android fundamentals and building blocks and you will feel more confident writing code. Final result should always be Win-Win for you and your sponsor.

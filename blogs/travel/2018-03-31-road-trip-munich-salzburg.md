Sudden planned a road trip from Eindhoven to Munich and Austria. The ride was amazing, Autobahn and seeing cars on top speed is a thrill on its own. We visited Munich (main attraction was BMW museum) and Salzburg Austria.

Here are a couple of photos:

If you are into road trips, travel via Autobahn once for sure.

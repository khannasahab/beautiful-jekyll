XMAS is a festival of family time. It might not be the best time to travel. We had holidays and we thought to spend 4 days in Prague. It was my second visit to Prague and I must say it was a decision well made. The lively city with ancient yet pretty river and lighting at night just leaves you in awe.

Here are a couple of photos:

Visited London first time. It was an official trip, I was there to attend an Android conference **droidcon**. First impression of the city was "A beautiful city with luxury cars all around". 

Attended the conference and visited a friend who was living near city airport. He showed me around the main tourist attractions. Later at night, we visited *Ministry of Sound' and it was definitely a unique experience on its own.

Here are a couple of photos:

It was a short trip and overall the impression of city is really good. Hope to visit soon again.

Dunkirk movie was relased lately and we were planning a trip. Visiting dunkirk sounded a superb idea. We were 4 friends, grabbed a car and drove towards Dunkirk. We started from Eindhoven, Netherlands early in the morning. Reached Dunkirk soon and to be honest, there was nothing touristic. Maybe it was wrong time of the year.We spent a night and drove to Les Loges. As they say, we are usually amazed when we do not have much expectations. This trip was same. Did not expect much from Les Loges and could not believe our eyes once we reached there. We took a long route in parallal to sea and it was simply amazing.

Here are a couple of photos:

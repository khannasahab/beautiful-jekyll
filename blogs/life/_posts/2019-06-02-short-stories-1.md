# Bear OR NOT

There were two men in a jungle and it starts raining. After sometime they got near a cave. Just before they thought to enter, they heard a loud roar from inside. It was like roar of a bear. But they wanted a place to spend night.

Being scared, one of them said; okay I will go inside first and find out is there any bear or not. Second man even being reluctant, agreed and waited outside. After sometime, the man outside heard another roar.

Now he has two options,

Go inside and find out himself there is any bear or not
Play safe and return as first option could be very costly if there is a bear
Hope you get point! Sometimes it is not worth to find out is there any bear or not :)


# The Carrying Monk

Once two Monks were on a journey. They were passing a Jungle and encountered a
river. While prepping to cross, one Woman reaches them and asks for help. While
Monk 1 was about to utter No, Monk2 agreed and carried woman on his shoulders.
Monk1 was surprised as they are not permitted to touch a woman.

They crossed river, dropped woman, shared smile with gratitude and left apart.
Monk2 was walking normally but Monk1 was upset after incident. Monk2 had no idea
about his mental state but he could sense something is wrong.

*On insisting, Monk1 said “How could you carry a woman when you know we are not
permitted”*

*Monk2 replied : “I just helped a person in need. I dropped her long back. You
are still carrying her inside you” Who is at fault ? Me OR You ?*

**Lesson :**Most of us do not live in present. Either we are carrying past OR
we are tensed about future. None of these will help. Secondly, Monk2 had no idea
about Monk1 mental state. If he would not have asked, Monk1 would have carried
it for long long time and suffered himself.

# The Angry Monk

Once a Monk was meditating at a river bank. He was in deep relaxed mode
concentrating on his breathing. He had tied his boat along with him. It was pin
drop silence until he heard someone bumped into his boat.

Monk did not want to spoil his rhythm, so he ignored and kept on meditating. But
again and again, he felt a bump and listened the noise. He was getting angry
inside. After few minutes, he felt so much anger that he decided to shout at
whoever was bumping in his boat.

Prepared to shout, he opens his eyes and all of sudden he was calmed down. He
saw it was one empty boat which must have slipped from somewhere with river flow
and it was stuck somewhere. Could not find its way but water current made it
bump into his boat.

He exclaimed, Yes anger is within me. It is just an empty boat.

**Lesson :**Most of time we all face similar situation. We become angry at
someone OR something without knowing the complete picture. Always remember,
anger is within us and we suffer a lot because of empty boat.

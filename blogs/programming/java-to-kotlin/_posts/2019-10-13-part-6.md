This is the part 6 of series [Java to Kotlin - Learning Simplified](/blogs/programming/java-to-kotlin/). I hope you are learning something new from every part. This part is very simple and easy to grasp. Consider it a break in this series.

### If as an Expression

---

{: .box-bordered}
As we know almost every language has `if-else` conditional control flow. Java and Kotlin both are no exception. They both have `if-else`. Interestingly in Kotlin `if-else` can be used as expression as well. Here is snippet:

```
	// Kotlin

	val abc = if(condition) value_1 else value_2

	fun doSomething(){
		return if(condition) value_1 else value_2
	}
```

💡 Both of the ways shown above are not possible in Java.

### When Expression

---

{: .box-bordered}
I am sure you are aware of `switch` statement in Java. Switch can be used when you have `if-else` ladder. Kotlin does not have `switch` keyword, It has `when` keyword offering same feature + more power at your disposal. Here is a snippet of code:


```
	// Kotlin
	val x = (Math.random() * 100).toInt()
	if(x == 10) { 

	} else if (x == 20) {

	} else if(x == 30) {

	} else if(x == 40) {

	} else {

	}
```

💡 As you saw above `if-else` ladder is not fun to read. Java has a `switch-case` offering, Here is Java solution:

```
	// Java
	switch(x){
		case 10:
		break;
		case 20:
		break;
		case 30:
		break;
		case 40:
		break;
		case 50:
		break;
		default:
		break;
	}
```

💡 This is surely better than if-else ladder but Java comes with its own overheads. There is a break after every case. If you do not add the break, next case will execute irrespective of the match. Honestly, its not nice. But kotlin played `smart` here and introduced `when`, Here is a  snippet:

```
	// Kotlin
	when(x) {
	10 -> doSomething()
	20 -> {
			doSomething2()
		  }
	30 -> doThat()
	else -> {}
	}
```

💡 As you saw above when is equivalent to switch but we do not need break statement after a block. Only the matching block will execute otherwise else block will. 

`Power of When`

In Java switch, we can combine two cases, lets say you want to execute two blocks. X is either 10 OR 20. In java you can write case 10 and case 20 without a break in between But in Kotlin all you need is a comma

```
	// Kotlin
	when(x) {
	10, 20 -> {}
	30, 40 -> {}
	}
```

`What to do if you want to match more than 2 conditions`

One answer is use multiple values with comma
```
	// Kotlin
	when(x) {
	10, 20, 30, 40 -> {}
	50, 60 -> {}
	}
```

Other solution is to use `Range`

<p id="range"></p><br/><br/>

---

{: .box-plain}
### 🔥 Range `..` 

---

Kotlin offers a syntax `..` whenever we need a range, could be range of numbers, chars etc. `1..10` means from 1 to 10 both inclusive. `A..Z` means all the capital alphabets. We can use range at multiple places, When block and for loop are two common use cases.


`When with range`
```
	// Kotlin
	when(x) {
	in 1..10 -> {}
	in 2..20 -> {}
	in 3..30 -> {}
	in 4..40 -> {}
	in 5..50 -> {}
	in 6..60 -> {}
	}
```

In the above code, if x is between 1 to 10 (both inclusive), the first block will execute.

We can use `!in` with range as well. It means not in range.

`When with range`
```
	// Kotlin
	when(x) {
	!in 1..10 -> {}
	in 2..20 -> {}
	}
```	

`!in 1..10` means not in 1 to 10, Any number not 1 to 10.

When with `is`

Do you remember `is`? it is used to check instance of in Kotlin. You can use it with `when`

```
	// Kotlin
	when(x){
		is String-> {}
		is Number-> {}
		is XYZ-> {}
	}
```

🔥 You can use variable declaration in when block. It is not allowed in Java

```
	// Java
	switch(final int x){}  ❌ not allowed
```

```	
	// Kotlin
	when(val x = "Gaurav") { ✅ allowed
		"Gaurav" -> println(x.toLowerCase()) 
	}
```

I hope you are amazed with the power of `when`, if not it has more to offer. There are cases when we have conditions like `<` `>` or `null check` or something else. When can be used without a variable as well.

```
	// Java
	switch { ❌ not allowed

	}
```

```
	// Kotlin 🔥🔥

	when { ✅ allowed

		x > y -> {}

		4 < 5 -> {}

		obj == null -> {}

		else ->{}
	}
```

One more, I promise. `when` can be used as expression as well. This is amazing.

```
	// Kotlin

	fun doSomething():String{
		return when {
			x > y -> {}

			4 < 5 -> {}

			obj == null -> {}

			else ->
		}
	}
```

💡 else is mandatory in such cases and the last statement of the block is returned

### 🔥 Range `..` with step

---

{: .box-bordered}
In last example of range we saw we can use `1..10` to express a range of 1 to 10. But what if we need all the even numbers from 1 to 100? That too is a range. There is a syntax for this as well. It is called `step` 

`0..100 step 2` is the range of all the even numbers till 100

**There is nothing like that in Java**


<p id="for_loop"></p><br/><br/>

---

{: .box-plain}
### For Loop (foreach)

---

{: .box-bordered}
In java we have a foreach loop, there is a better alternative in Kotlin. Lets say we have an array of String name `cities`. Here is a snippet:

```
	// Java
	for(String city:cities) {}
```

```
	// Kotlin
	for(city:String in cities){}
```

The syntax is `for in`, we just saw above `in` syntax works very well with range as well. How about we combine `for loop with range`

```
	// Kotlin
	for(i in 1..10){}
```

The java equivalent is `for i` loop

```
	// Java
	for (int i=1; i<=10; i++){}
```

In my opinion, Kotlin variant is more readable. Wait, do you remember `step` with `range`? How about we add step in for loop?

```
	// Kotlin, loop with i = 1, 3, 5, 7.. (equivalent of += in java)

	for(i in 1..10 step 2){}
```

All of the `step` we saw are in increment fashion. What about decrement? In Java, we can easily do `i=10; i>=0;i--`, how about in Kotlin?

```
	// Kotlin
	for(i in 10 downTo 1 step 2){}
```

The above snippet will work with `i = 10, 8, 6 ...` Remember `10..1` will not work!! 

💡 `for-in` can be used with any type which has `iterator`, It means it can be used with arrays, collections.


<p id="labelled_block"></p><br/><br/>

{: .box-plain}
### Labelled Block

---

{: .box-bordered}
This is one of the feature a very few developers use. Java and Kotlin both offer labelled blocks. The syntax is little different. Assume you are in nested loop and you want to `break` from the outer loop, Here is the snippet:

```
	// Java
	iloop:
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		jloop:
		for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
			kloop:
        	for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++) {
				if (k == 3) {
				break jloop;
				}
				if (k == 4) {
				break iloop;
				}
			}
		}
	}
```

```
	// Kotlin
	iloop@
    for (i in 1..10) {
        jloop@
        for (j in 1..10) {
            kloop@
            for (k in 1..10) {
                if (k == 3) {
                    break@jloop
                }
                if (k == 4) {
                    break@iloop
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

💡 Kotlin has the syntax `name@` for labelled blocks and while using you have to use `@name`

### Summary

---

{: .box-bordered}
We saw power of kotlin in tiny offerings like `If as an expression`, and `When` block which is powerful alternative to switch. When can be used when you have a direct comparison like switch OR when you have multiple `if elses`. It can also be used as an `Expression`.<br/><br/> Then we saw `range` the syntax `..` can be used in places like comparison inside when OR for loop. Decrement range can be calculated with `downTo` syntax. `Range with step` can be used when the increment OR decrement step is other than 1. <br/><br/> For in loop is similar to Java for each loop and can be combined with range. It can be used with any type which has iterator like array and collection. <br/><br/> Finally we saw Labelled block is same like Java with different sytanx `label@`.

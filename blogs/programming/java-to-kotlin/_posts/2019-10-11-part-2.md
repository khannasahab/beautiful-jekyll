This is the part 2 of series [Java to Kotlin - Learning Simplified](/blogs/programming/java-to-kotlin/). This part is to show the difference in basics of Java & Kotlin. I hope you learn something new from every part. If you are not convinced why do you need Kotlin and want to know little history, [check Part 1](/blogs/programming/java-to-kotlin/part-1/)

ðŸ’¡ Remember our 3 core principles? **Concise, Smart and Powerful** 

>Wherever possible, Kotlin tries to be concise and compiler is smart to help developers at compile time. Plus, Kotlin has some powerful offerings which we will see later. 

Topics in Part 2: [Semicolon](#semicolon), [File & Package](#file-package), [Access Modifier](#access-modifier), [Equals ==](#equals), [String Concatination](#string-concat), [Variable](#variable), [New Instance](#new-instance), [Class Definition](#class-definition), [Inheritance](#open-keyword)

### 1.  SemiColon ; 

---

{: .box-bordered}
Let's start with the simplest syntax change. In Java, semicolon is mandatory after every statement but in Kotlin it is optional, compiler adds one for you. **"The concise principle"** *`Your muscle memory is not going to embrace it but why to press one extra keystroke?`* Here is a snippet:

{: .accordian}
```
	// Java
	callSomeMethod();
	x = 5;

	// Kotlin
	callSomeMethod()
	x = 5
```

<p id="file-package"></p><br/><br/>

---

### 2.  File & Package name

---

{: .box-bordered}
Java file ends with `.java` extension and Kotlin file ends with `.kt` extension. <br/><br/>In Java we can have many classes in a file but it has a weird restriction. There must be a public class with same name as the file name. Kotlin says why? There might be some logical reasoning back then but now IDE is powerful and we do not need that restriction any more. `In kotlin, there is no such restriction`. Class name can differ from the file name. <br/><br/> Another difference is package name. In Java, the package name of the class must match the file path. It means if you have a Java file in `src/util`, the package name has to be `src.util` but in Kotlin there is no such restriction. You can write whatever you want as package name. However, it is considered a good practice to use file path as package name.

<p id="access-modifier"></p><br/><br/>

---

{: .box-plain}
### 3.  Access Modifiers

---

{: .box-bordered}
In Java, we have `public, private, protected and default` access modifiers. <br/><br/>In kotlin, we have `public private, protected and internal`. The difference is if we do not specify anything in Java, it becomes `default` which is package-private. But in Kotlin, if we do not specify anything it is `public`. <br/> <br/> Another difference is in `private`. In java, private means accessible only in the same Class but in Kotlin, private means accessible in the File. We will cover File later. Same goes to `protected`, they are available to file + subclasses.<br/><br/> ðŸ”¥ Internal is a new access modifier in Kotlin and it is really nice. If you work in multi module projects, then you are going to love it. `Internal` fields and classes are available in the module. It is like public with a scope limited to module.

<p id="equals"></p><br/><br/>

---

{: .box-plain}
### 4.  Equals == and ===

---

{: .box-bordered}
In Jave we use `==` to check objects are exact same or not and we use `equals` method to check meaninful equivalence. That means equals as per business logic. <br/><br/> But Kotlin being concise and smart, encourages to use `==` for meaningful equivalence. When we use `==` in Kotlin, it uses `equals` method under the hood. If you want to check objecs are exact same OR not, use `===`. Summary is `===` of Kotlin is same as `==` of Java and `==` of Kotlin is same as `equals` method as compiler changes it.

```
	// Java
	Car car = new Car();
	Car car2 = new Car();

	car == car2 // false, checks the objects are same in memory
	car.equals() // true/false depends on business logic

	// Kotlin
	val car = Car() // ignor how variable is defined, we will learn
	val car2 = Car()
	car.equals(car2) //  true/false depends on business logic. 
	car == car2 // same as above, Converts to .equals
	car === car3 // false, checks the objects are same in memory

```

<p id="string-concat"></p><br/><br/>

{: .box-plain}
### 5.  String concatenation and Expression

---

{: .box-bordered}
This is one of the area Java is really ugly to look at. We need to use either `+` operator to concatenate strings OR use string formatter. Former option is mostly used in common places like printing logs.<br/><br/>Kotlin offers a neat way, string templates. You can print value of the object inside a string liternal using `$`. Check the snippet below, both are same:

```
	// Java
	String name = "Gaurav"
	System.out.println("My Name is " + name);

	// Kotlin
	val name = "Gaurav"
	println("My Name is $name")

```

Read more in the offical [documentation here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html#using-string-templates)

### Expressions inside string literal

{: .box-bordered}
This is where Kotlin shines. Suppose you have to use some expression while concatenating Strings. You might need to call a function OR you might need to perform some arithmatic operation. Kotlin offers another syntax `${expression_here}`. Check the snippet below, both output are same:

```
	// Java
	Car car = new Car();
	System.out.println("My Car is " + car.getCompany() + "And model is " + car.getModel());

	// Kotlin
	val car = Car()
	println("My Car is ${car.company} And model is ${car.model}")

```

Note: Ignore getter-setter in Kotlin code for now, We will explain later. To keep you surprised, kotlin code is also using getter-setter under the hood. Remember, I said expressions inside literal. Check the code below:

```
	// Kotlin
	val i = 10;
	println("Number $i is ${ if(i % 2 == 0) "Even" else "Odd"}")

```

### 6.  Defining Variable

---

{: .box-bordered}
This is one of the area where your habitual brain will complain. Remember it does not like change. In Java we define a variable by first telling its visibility, then the type and then the name of the variable.<br/><br/>Kotlin has little different philosophy here. Remember Kotlin is made to reduce errors. One of the error prone area is mutable states in Java. So Kotlin made it mandatory to choose. In Kotlin we define a variable by telling visibility, then it is mutable OR immutable, then name, then type. Check the snippet below:

```
	// Java

	private Car car; // visibility, type and name

	// Kotlin

	private val car:Car // visibility, mutablity, name and type

```

{: .box-bordered}
`val and var` are two keywords used in Kotlin to define mutablity. `val` means it is an `immutable value` and `var` means `mutable variable`. `val` is equivalent to `final` in Java. Check Another Snippet:

```
	// Java

	Car car; // default visibility in Java

	// Kotlin

	val car:Car // default is public in Kotlin
```

```
	// Kotlin

	val x = 1 // Kotlin knows it is Int
	x = 5 // error, x is final

	var y = 1
	y = 5 // all good, y is var (mutable)
```

<p id="new-instance"></p><br/><br/>

{: .box-plain}
### 7.  Creating Objects, New Instances

---

{: .box-bordered}
This is very simple. Java uses the keyword `new` followed by Constructor but Kotlin keeping its `concise` promise does not use the `new` keyword. It uses only `constructor`

```
	// Java

	Car car = new Car();

	// Kotlin

	val car : Car = Car();
```

The above kotlin snippet does not use `new` keyword. Kotlin `smart` principle can also be applied here. We can drop the type of the Object, Kotlin compiler can deduce the type from the Constructor. It is called `Type Inference` which means based on the value, compiler can figure out the type. 

```
	val car = Car() // This is pure Kotlin flavor, concise and smart

	val i = 5 // compiler knows it is Int

	val x = "text" // compiler knows it is String
```


{: .box-plain}
### ðŸ’¡ [`Important! Immutability`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object)

{: .box-bordered}
In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object (unchangeable object) is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This is in contrast to a mutable object (changeable object), which can be modified after it is created. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object)<br/><br/> Java has the notion of `immutability` but you have to explicitly define what is `immutable`. By default, classes and fields are `mutable`. Whereas Kotlin took another approach, it claims `immutability` leads to hard-to-find bugs. Thus everything by default is `immutable` and you have to explicit mark `mutable`


<p id="class-definition"></p><br/><br/>

{: .box-plain}
### 8.  Class Definition

---

{: .box-bordered}
In java, the classes are defined with keyword `class` assigining them a name, a visibility modifier, and optional `final` to mark them `immutable`. Default visibility is `default package`<br/><br/> In Kotlin, The default visibility is `public` and `final` is not required as classes are `final` by default (It means you can not extend them, they are `immutable`). Here is a equivalent snippet in both langauges :

```
	// Java
	public final class Car{}

	// Kotlin
	class Car{}

	/* public and final are not required in Kotlin */
```

{: .box-plain}
#### ðŸ’¡ My take: Initially I found it hard to accept, why everything is final. But the more I used, the more I realised It makes more sense. it allows us to think architecture better. Now we make classes `Extendable` only if required and it has proven to be more effective.

### `So how to make classes extendable?`

<p id="open-keyword"></p><br/><br/>

---

{: .box-plain}
### 9. open Keyword

---

{: .box-bordered}
Kotlin does not have notion of `final` keyword, class by default is not-extendable (`final`) which means `closed`. You can mark any class extendable with `open` keyword. here is a snippet:

```
	open class Car{}

	// Now car is extendable
```

### `So how to extend a class`

---

{: .box-plain}
### 10. Inheritance - extend a class

---

{: .box-bordered}
In Java, we extend a class with `extends` keyword. Simple and Nice. <br/><br/> In Kotlin, there is not `extends` keyword but there is a syntax for that. We use **colon** `:`. Here is a snippet:

```
	// Java
	public class Car{}
	public class RaceCar extends Car{}

	// Kotlin
	open class Car{}
	class RaceCar:Car(){} 
```

#### ðŸ’¡ RaceCar is closed, `()` after super class is to call the constructor, we will see later

## Summary

---

{: .box-bordered}
We covered some differences between Kotlin and Java. If you are java developer, a few might seem absurd at first sight but trust me, it is your brain not liking the change. We see mainly 3 principles are at work `Concise, Smart and Powerful`. <br/><br> The very basic difference is no `semicolon` in Kotlin, No restriction on file name and public class name inside, `default visibility` modifer is `public` in Kotlin, internal visibility means inside package, `== calls equals` and `===` is used to `compare objects in memory`, Strings allow concatenation with `$variable` and we can evaluate expressions inside string with `${}`, variables are defined with `val and var`, `val` means `final` and `var` are `immutable`, Kotlin offers `type inference` and assigns the type to variable based on the value assigned, `Classes are final` by default and we need `open keyword` to make them `extendable`, and finally there is no `extends` keyword, but we use syntax colon `:` to extend a class.

### Preface 

{: .box-plain}
>Our motto from this series is to simplify the complex and scary words we see when it comes to Android build files. This series bridges the gap between Gradle and Android project. 

 At the end of this series, you should be able to easily modify your build gradle files and you should be confident in Android project structure.

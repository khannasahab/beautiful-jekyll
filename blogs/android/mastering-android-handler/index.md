### Preface 

{: .box-plain}
>Our motto from this series is to understand Android Handler. We, Android developers use Handler a lot of time. Sometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly. This series tries to simplify basics.
<br/>

**Note**: We expect knowledge of Android basics like Activity, UI Thread, Context. If you are a new developer who is starting journey to Android world, this might not be the best place.

*This is a long series, grab a coffee/tea/kahwa/beer and get started*

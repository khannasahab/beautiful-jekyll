**Why am I a good candidate?**
<br/><br/>
 I have always been an Engineer with users in the center of all solutions I have architected or programmed. I love to see ideas shaping into a real product. I believe not every idea you have will form into feature and ideas come from all the places. I believe in Data-driven development and user-centric teams.
<br/>
I am good at having a sound communication with designers and developers which is a crucial aspect of any software development.
<br/><br/>
**Track Record**
<br/><br/>
I have tried 3 start-ups of my own. 2 of them were app based. One was selected in FB start-up with 5k downloads and other is an ongoing app with more than 110k+ downloads and decent revenue. I am responsible for developing Android app, product management, prioritizing ideas, engaging users, user-review replies and managing freelancer team I have. In short, a lean startup. I consider tech as a tool to achieve your vision and we should be flexible in using another tool if it is more appropriate.

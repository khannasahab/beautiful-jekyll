### Projects

***SmartLightApps (Hobby Project)***<br/> [Website: smartlightapps.com](https://smartlightapps.com)
<br/><br/>
I really like IOT and lights in general. Worked on a side project to combine all smart lights under one umbrella. We thought of blogging to make users familiar with smart light use cases and develop one app for all brands. Started with Philips hue because of familiarity with the system. Philips app is named HueHello and users are appreciating it. We aim to develop apps for all smart lights using same core.<br/>

One of its kind and market leader in smart lights: philips hue. Part of the android team with core responsibility of architecting and developing Hue app. **Presented** Hue app to many stakeholders inside the company and pushed for **modular architecture, Material design** and more use of Git. It is way more complex app than it appears from outlook due to underlying protocol involved (*Zigbee*).
